# Project-Ideas

Hey there! 

So you got a fancy idea you'd like to share? Feel free to edit this file with the details about your project. Don't write a PhD thesis alright, just write the basic stuff like what it's all about and why you'd want to others to work on it.

Alright, that's it for now, we'll be in touch to discuss the project further. 

*Your project idea goes below this line* 

`Project Idea`
### Cookbook for Web Development(no foo-foo).

- **Explanation** : I think, we must collect hacks and tricks on various XYZ technologies and prepare an opensource cookbook, all hacks will specially focus on web development(for now). Developer on finding any hack or an easy way to code a thing, can share that in this cookbook which people can read on internet.
Personal blog, articles etc. generally do not recieve as much attention as author wants. How about everyone contribute their knowledge at the same place?

- **Example** : I once shared `How to improved default heading elements in sass`, which is an easy hack, and do not even require knowledge of sass completely.

- **Hey! But then a thousand websites do the same thing, what is different here?!** : Well, yeah you are right, and I won't argue on it. I always think of publishing those hack without unnecessary details, explanation etc. like no foo-foo sh\*t, plus, we are not going to develop a website, pay for it or carry any liability. This will all be on social media and ofcourse github.
