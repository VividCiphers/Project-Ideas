# Project-Ideas

Hey there! 

So you got a fancy idea you'd like to share? Feel free to edit this file with the details about your project. Don't write a PhD thesis alright, just write the basic stuff like what it's all about and why you'd want to others to work on it.

Alright, that's it for now, we'll be in touch to discuss the project further. 

*Your project idea goes below this line* 

`Project Idea`
### Cookbook for Web Development(no foo-foo).

- **Explanation** : I think, we must collect hacks and tricks on various XYZ technologies and prepare an opensource cookbook, all hacks will specially focus on web development(for now). Developer on finding any hack or an easy way to code a thing, can share that in this cookbook which people can read on internet.
Personal blog, articles etc. generally do not recieve as much attention as author wants. How about everyone contribute their knowledge at the same place?

- **Example** : I once shared `How to improved default heading elements in sass`, which is an easy hack, and do not even require knowledge of sass completely.

- **Hey! But then a thousand websites do the same thing, what is different here?!** : Well, yeah you are right, and I won't argue on it. I always think of publishing those hack without unnecessary details, explanation etc. like no foo-foo sh\*t, plus, we are not going to develop a website, pay for it or carry any liability. This will all be on social media and ofcourse github.


### Rebuild all of thinsoldier's old projects

Rebuild all of thinsoldier's old projects with other technologies and/or refactor them with their current technologies to be better.

- **[Cinemix data](http://thinsoldier.com/cinemix/)**: I have 631,251 database records (and counting) logging every song that has been played on my favourite online radio station over the years. We could make an api that allows any front-end to query the data. Individuals or groups of team members can make their own projects that consume that api. Someone who just does design can propose a new design for my current version of the project. We can pick 1 design and then try out various CSS naming conventions of the same design and see what the pro's and cons are.  
  
  The database records are generated by some web-scraping code written in php they gets run as a cron job every 60 seconds. The current front-end is super basic server side rendered php. Someone can rebuild that in node or python if they wanted to. My web server does not support node or python. unless I upgrade to a much more expensive package.
  
  This would be a good project because you already have fully working code to refer to and can just replicate that functionality with your preferred stack.
