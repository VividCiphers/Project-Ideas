# Vivid Cipher's Library

### Whats the idea?
In this project we will be going to create a small front-end web-app for displaying catalog of all the developer books that are stored in our google drive.
This app will help developers to search for books, view details and download them.

### Pictures speaks 100x louder than words

### Whats the plan?
I have decided to use some front-end library to create this app. I am thinking of **ReactJS** and **Jsx** to write this app.
To store details on books **JSON** will be used primarily, if someone having fair knowledge of handeling **APIs** please pull request ;)
Designing should be done in **SASS** for a modular design system.
To create boilerplate of the app, **create-react-app** will be used.

### How to begin?
Currently, this project will be handled by teamleaders at Vivid Ciphers, particularly me(Amrit Pandey), John Vincent and Anna Ryder. I am planning to add few ReactJS experts in the group for consulting purposes.
Once we setup the basic project and is ready with whole application structure, others are free to join and pull request.
